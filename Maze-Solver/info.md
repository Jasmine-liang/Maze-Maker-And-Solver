## Notice
The maze we're dealing here has only one solution    
Butï¼Œ in terms of maze that has multiple solutions
- DFS will give us only the first found solution
- BFS will give us the shortest solution, because each time it takes a step in all the possible direction. The first found solution is the shortest one.    
Each file contains an info.md that shows the result image:)
